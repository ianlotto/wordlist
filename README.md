Wordlist
========

A simple class that takes a list of words from a separate file on initialization. Then, does things with the words...

So far:

- `#by_word_length` - Puts the words into a hash organized by word-length
- `#subwords_from_length` - Quickly and efficiently finds all subwords in the list that can be combined to create words of a given length.
